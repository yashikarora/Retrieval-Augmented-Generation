# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG)

# Overview:
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of information retrieval (IR) and natural language generation (NLG). It enhances the capabilities of a language model by augmenting it with external knowledge retrieved from a large corpus, such as a database or a set of documents. This technique is particularly useful when the language model lacks specific information to generate accurate or contextually relevant responses.

# Key Components:

# Semantic Search:

Purpose: To retrieve the most relevant documents or data chunks from a large corpus that can aid the generation process.
Implementation: Utilizes a pre-trained language model fine-tuned for semantic search. The model converts queries and documents into vector representations, allowing for efficient similarity search using techniques like cosine similarity or approximate nearest neighbors.
Corpus: The corpus can be a database, a collection of documents, or any structured data relevant to the task. The quality of retrieval depends heavily on the diversity and relevance of this corpus.
# Fine-tuned Language Model:

Purpose: To generate responses based on the retrieved documents and the original query.
Implementation: A language model, such as GPT or another transformer-based model, is fine-tuned on specific tasks to improve its ability to integrate retrieved information and generate contextually accurate responses.
Augmentation Process: The language model takes the retrieved documents as additional context, which informs the generation process. This augmentation allows the model to produce more accurate, fact-based, and contextually relevant outputs.

# How It Works:

Query Input: The user inputs a query or prompt.
Document Retrieval: The query is used to search the corpus, retrieving the top-k most relevant documents or information chunks using semantic search.
Response Generation: The retrieved documents, combined with the original query, are passed to the fine-tuned language model. The model uses this augmented input to generate a response that is both informative and contextually appropriate.
